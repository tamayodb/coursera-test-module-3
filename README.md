### This is a single-page responsive website. The page includes a navigation bar, a page heading, and a tall section displaying menu content. The website is built using the Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework to ensure responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Implementation details are as follows:
* Navbar: The navbar contains the company name "Food, LLC" aligned to the left side. For desktop and tablet views, the navbar only displays the company name. Other buttons are hidden using the 'visible-xs' class.
* Navbar - Mobile View
  - In mobile view, a menu button with three horizontal bars is displayed.
  - When clicked, a dropdown menu appears with three items: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi.
  - The dropdown menu takes up the entire width of the browser window and has a distinct background color.
* Page Heading: The page heading "Our Menu" is centered within the browser window using a Bootstrap class for text alignment.
* Tall Section
  - The tall section utilizes the Bootstrap Grid system to take up the entire width of the browser window.
  - It is designed to be tall enough to require scrolling to view the bottom content.
  - The background color of the tall section is set to distinguish it from the rest of the content.
* Responsive Design
  - Desktop View (md): Uses Bootstrap md-based classes for navbar, page heading, and tall section.
  - Tablet View (sm): Corresponds to Bootstrap sm-based classes for responsive design.
  - Mobile View (xs): Utilizes Bootstrap xs-based classes for mobile responsiveness, including the mobile menu dropdown.
